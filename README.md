# Workshop Azure Functions 2018
## Server-less .NET solutions using Azure Functions

Welcome to the workshop "Server-less .NET solutions using Azure Functions". 

In this workshop you will create a .NET based solution with Azure Functions using Visual Studio 2017.

To get the best experience with the hands-on-labs it is recommended that you prepare the following:
- Laptop for development and running Azure Functions locally
- Azure subscription to create, publish, host and use your Azure Functions

### Preparing for workshop

Even though you can certainly participate in this workshop with an unprepared laptop, it will save a lot of time to install your development machine ahead of time. In [Lab 0 - Getting started](docs/Lab0-GettingStarted.md) you will find a list of the recommended tools to install on your laptop or development Virtual Machine.

Additionally, for hosting your Azure Functions in Microsoft Azure you will need an Azure subscription. You can create a trial account if you do not have a subscription available.
